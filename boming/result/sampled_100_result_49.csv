    3. Rank the 'Candidate News' headlines based on their relevance. The ranking criteria should prioritize:
    - Headlines matching both the key themes and keywords from the user's history.

    # Understanding Themes and Keywords:
    - A 'theme' is the overarching subject or topic of a news headline, such as 'technology', 'politics', or 'environment'.

    1. From each headline in 'User's History News', identify one central theme and extract five key keywords. This identification captures both the general and specific interests of the user.
    2. For each headline in 'Candidate News', identify one primary theme and five relevant keywords, considering how they might relate to the historical themes and keywords.

    # Recommendation Process:
    1. From each headline in 'User's History News', identify one central theme and extract five key keywords. This identification captures both the general and specific interests of the user.
    2. For each headline in 'Candidate News', identify one primary theme and five relevant keywords, considering how they might relate to the historical themes and keywords.

    - For each headline, provide a brief justification based on its theme and keyword alignment, e.g., ""C1 aligns with the theme X and includes keywords A, B, C, matching the user's interest in headlines H1, H2, H3.""
    - Follow this structure for all top 10 headlines.
