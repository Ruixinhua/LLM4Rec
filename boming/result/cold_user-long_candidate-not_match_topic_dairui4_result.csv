Perhaps this in-your-face display of kidneys gone wild will at least encourage designers in Munich to think twice before traveling further down this road. Us Motor1.com scribes work very hard to keep a neutral tone, but frankly, we're a bit worried about BMW. This big-grille fad is as ridiculous as the pet rock only without the cool hipster factor. It's as off-putting as listening to glam rock on a scratched-up record. We blame Lexus for this, and while some brands have pulled off the gaping grille with admirable results   we're looking at you, Audi RS6 Avant   oversized kidneys basically turn every BMW into a beaver joke waiting to happen. That's not a good thing. Bigger Isn't Better: BMW Concept 4 Debuts With Massive Double Kidney Grille Reviled BMW Concept 4 Grille Redesigned By Another Fan We aren't alone on this. Peruse the comments of any Motor1.com articles referencing this bonkers nose and you'll find plenty of criticism. Rendering artists the world over have attempted to make the big grille look better, while others   including the anonymous designer who graciously sent us the designs featured above   are ready to show us a world where every BMW is, in a word, ugly. And yes, with BMW's deep involvement in the Toyota Supra, we couldn't resist leading with a makeover that could well come to the Supra's convertible twin, the Z4. Sure, the facelift could've been on an actual Z4, but seeing the double kidney on a Supra has a bit more shock factor. Jump into the slideshow at the top of this article to see just how deep   and how big   this kidney-shaped rabbit hole can grow.

But the Seahawks, Packers and Saints all lurk closely behind with 5-1 records. The AFC is a different story, as the Patriots improved to 6-0 and the once 4-0 Chiefs have since suffered straight losses. Which teams, chasing the two conference leaders, will make the strongest case that they are the top contender in their respective conferences this week?
Many teams are reaching the midpoint of their season, making this slate of Week 8 contests pivotal in terms of which teams will be competing down the stretch and which could be playing relatively meaningless football in a month's time. Is there a middling team poised to make a mid-season run? And will the Patriots and 49ers continue their winning ways and remain the only two unbeaten teams in football?

Based on New England's schedule, five teams over the next six weeks have chances to spoil Patriots perfection. If they all fail, chances are Tom Brady, Bill Belichick and Co. will go undefeated in the regular season.","N29393

A group traveling along a remote road in Gjirokast r, Albania, on November 11 had to do a double-take as they passed a flock of sheep blocking traffic. There, among the sheep, was an equally white and fluffy dog who looked more than happy to join the crowd. A German visitor to the region, Matthias Goedeking, took the video and told Storyful that he and his traveling companions originally came across ""a herd of sheep on the road and a shepherd who was visibly unhappy about that fact.""

Goedeking said a combination of very careful driving, the ""shepherd banging his crook"" on a railing, as well as ""lots of honking the car"" got him and his companions past the horde of furry creatures in the end.

A group traveling along a remote road in Gjirokast r, Albania, on November 11 had to do a double-take as they passed a flock of sheep blocking traffic. There, among the sheep, was an equally white and fluffy dog who looked more than happy to join the crowd. A German visitor to the region, Matthias Goedeking, took the video and told Storyful that he and his traveling companions originally came across ""a herd of sheep on the road and a shepherd who was visibly unhappy about that fact."" When they spotted the dog in the crowd, they followed alongside the pooch for a while, before it disappeared   Where's Waldo? style   into the white mass of sheep surrounding it. Goedeking said a combination of very careful driving, the ""shepherd banging his crook"" on a railing, as well as ""lots of honking the car"" got him and his companions past the horde of furry creatures in the end.
