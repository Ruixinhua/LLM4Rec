Arnold Schwarzenegger dropped by Jimmy Kimmel Live!, Monday, and the legendary action star could not stop gushing over his new son-in-law Chris Pratt. Chris married Katherine Schwarzenegger in June, but only after he proved to Arnold that he was strong enough to be her man. When Katherine first told Arnold that she was dating Chris, the former governor of California said he was ""blown away."" ""I was saying do you have to be so competitive?"" recalled Arnold. ""Do you have to have a guy that is taller than me, that is bigger than me, that's doing bigger movies than me and all of this kind of stuff, that makes more money than me?"" Arnold says he immediately got along with Chris. ""He is such a great guy, said Arnold. ""Not only very talented guy and a great actor and a great star and all this stuff but a really kind man and kind to my daughter, which is the most important thing for me."" While all of the aforementioned traits are things most parents look for in their children's spouse, Arnold admitted Chris's muscles helped. Arnold joked, ""Pumping iron was the decision-making factor."" Arnold worked out with Chris and was quite impressed. ""He's a strong guy, there's no two ways about it, and I'm very proud of him,"" said Arnold. ""When I watched him make these moves in the gym, you know, the incline press specifically did it. Why I wanted him to become my son-in-law. It was the incline press.""
