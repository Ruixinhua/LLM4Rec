The final puzzle in regulation game play was a phrase, which quickly became ""TH_ Q_ _STION R_ _ _INS."" The first contestant guessed ""the question rounds"" and ""the question raising."" The second contestant added an ""M"" and then guessed ""the question reminds."" And finally the third contestant bought an ""E"" resulting in the puzzle ""THE Q_ ESTION RE_ _INS."" He didn't even try to guess before the buzzer sounded. Host Pat Sajak was shocked all three contestants could not solve the puzzle. And fans at home took to Twitter to voice their opinions on the matter. The puzzle came full circle and the first contestant got another crack at it. This time she guessed correctly, causing Sajak to exclaim, ""Good job. I never thought it would get back to you!""

All together now!
Former NFL defensive lineman Justin Bannan is sitting in a Colorado jail, on charges of suspicion of attempted first-degree murder.
A bus that was partially swallowed when a sinkhole opened during morning rush hour in downtown Pittsburgh has been removed from the hole. Authorities said earlier Monday that two cranes arrived to remove the city bus.
Kanye West has been making headlines lately for his Sunday Service, an invitation-only event that started earlier this year in which the rapper-turned-preacher performs with live musical accompaniment. Apparently, there are big profits in his piety.","N32536

The deal requires Ford to invest more than $6 billion in its U.S. manufacturing operations and create or retain 8,500 U.S. jobs, while also allowing the automaker to close an engine plant in Michigan.","  User's Interest: Sports

Ranked Recommendations:

1. C3: Report: At least 24 teams expected to attend Kaepernick's workout
2. C5: United Auto Workers union approves new labor deal with Ford
3. C2: Bill Gates tops Jeff Bezos as world's richest person with Amazon slide
4. C4: George Conway and Trump Jr. trade personal insults during impeachment hearing
5. C1: New Jersey football game: 5 men are arrested; 3 people hurt

Explanation:

The user's interest in sports is evident from their historical news clicks, which include articles about boxing, NFL, and sports-related topics. Therefore, news items that align with this interest have been ranked higher in the recommendation list.

C3 and C5 are ranked higher because they directly relate to sports, with C3 reporting on a significant sports event (Kaepernick's workout) and C5 discussing a new labor deal in the automotive industry (which may impact sports-related businesses).

C2 and C4 are ranked lower because, although they mention prominent figures, they do not directly relate to sports. C2 discusses Bill Gates and Jeff Bezos' wealth, while C4 reports on a personal feud between George Conway and Trump Jr., neither of which aligns with the user's interest in sports.

C1 is ranked fifth because, although it mentions a football game, the focus of the article is on the arrests and injuries, rather than the game itself.

In summary, the ranking is based solely on the relevance of the candidate news to the user's interest in sports, without considering the order in which the news items appear in the 'CANDIDATE NEWS' set.","C3,C5,C2,C4,C1",0.5,0.33333,0.5,0.5
