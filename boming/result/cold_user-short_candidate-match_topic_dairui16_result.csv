Explanation:

The user's interest in sports is evident from their historical news clicks, which include articles about boxing, NFL, and sports-related topics. Therefore, news items that align with this interest have been ranked higher in the recommendation list.

C3 and C5 are ranked higher because they directly relate to sports, with C3 reporting on a significant sports event (Kaepernick's workout) and C5 discussing a new labor deal in the automotive industry (which may impact sports-related businesses).

C2 and C4 are ranked lower because, although they mention prominent figures, they do not directly relate to sports. C2 discusses Bill Gates and Jeff Bezos' wealth, while C4 reports on a personal feud between George Conway and Trump Jr., neither of which aligns with the user's interest in sports.

C1 is ranked fifth because, although it mentions a football game, the focus of the article is on the arrests and injuries, rather than the game itself.

In summary, the ranking is based solely on the relevance of the candidate news to the user's interest in sports, without considering the order in which the news items appear in the 'CANDIDATE NEWS' set.","C3,C5,C2,C4,C1",0.5,0.33333,0.5,0.5

A U.S. Military Academy cadet who vanished last week has been found dead, officials said Wednesday.
It was apparently a tough night for the Wheel of Fortune contestants Tuesday. All three contestants struggled to solve a puzzle, which seemed fairly simple. The final puzzle in regulation game play was a phrase, which quickly became ""TH_ Q_ _STION R_ _ _INS."" The first contestant guessed ""the question rounds"" and ""the question raising."" The second contestant added an ""M"" and then guessed ""the question reminds."" And finally the third contestant bought an ""E"" resulting in the puzzle ""THE Q_ ESTION RE_ _INS."" He didn't even try to guess before the buzzer sounded. Host Pat Sajak was shocked all three contestants could not solve the puzzle. And fans at home took to Twitter to voice their opinions on the matter. The puzzle came full circle and the first contestant got another crack at it. This time she guessed correctly, causing Sajak to exclaim, ""Good job. I never thought it would get back to you!""
The Los Angeles County District Attorney's Office has formally dropped a case against actor Kevin Spacey, after the accuser died.","N46917

SPRINGFIELD, Mass. (AP)   Bill Russell finally accepted his Basketball Hall of Fame ring. The 11-time NBA champion, five-time MVP, Olympic gold medalist and two-time NCAA champ said on Twitter on Friday that he was presented with his Hall of Fame ring in a private ceremony. The 85-year-old Boston Celtics great didn't attend the induction ceremony in 1975.
