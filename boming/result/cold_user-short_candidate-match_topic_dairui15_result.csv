A U.S. Military Academy cadet who vanished last week has been found dead, officials said Wednesday.
It was apparently a tough night for the Wheel of Fortune contestants Tuesday. All three contestants struggled to solve a puzzle, which seemed fairly simple. The final puzzle in regulation game play was a phrase, which quickly became ""TH_ Q_ _STION R_ _ _INS."" The first contestant guessed ""the question rounds"" and ""the question raising."" The second contestant added an ""M"" and then guessed ""the question reminds."" And finally the third contestant bought an ""E"" resulting in the puzzle ""THE Q_ ESTION RE_ _INS."" He didn't even try to guess before the buzzer sounded. Host Pat Sajak was shocked all three contestants could not solve the puzzle. And fans at home took to Twitter to voice their opinions on the matter. The puzzle came full circle and the first contestant got another crack at it. This time she guessed correctly, causing Sajak to exclaim, ""Good job. I never thought it would get back to you!""
The Los Angeles County District Attorney's Office has formally dropped a case against actor Kevin Spacey, after the accuser died.","N46917
