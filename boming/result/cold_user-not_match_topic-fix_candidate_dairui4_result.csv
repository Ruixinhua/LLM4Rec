After some dumb thing called the World Series tragically preempted The Masked Singer for two friggin' weeks in a friggin' row   prompting Twitter outrage and ruining everyone's Halloween-week fun (for Masked Singer fans, apparently there is crying in baseball)   this Wednesday, Fox finally got back to focusing on America's real favorite pastime: watching C- and D-list mystery celebrities dress up in Halloween-inspo costumes and belt out Lizzo and OneRepublic hits. And it was a double-header, to use some baseball terminology, because Fox made up for lost time by airing two episodes back-to-back. Of course, double the fun meant double the eliminations, so this week we had to bid farewell to two furry friends: the Penguin, aka comedian Sherri Shepherd, and the Black Widow, aka former child star Raven-Symone. Jenny McCarthy had guessed that pretty much every female contestant since Season1 was Shepherd, so she was destined to be correct eventually. As for the Black Widow, I got that one right. I knew that eight-legged diva was so Raven from the very beginning. Anyway, while I have missed The Masked Singer like a Rottweiler misses his bone, a flower misses the sun, or a black widow misses her web, on the plus side, the past two weeks have given me some time off to reflect, furiously pore over various Google search queries and Wikipedia pages, and change my uneducated guesses since the last time many of these kooky cosplay characters rocked the mic. I now return to the show refreshed, renewed, and ready to keep my semi-winning streak going.","N55237

Let's try to emphasize the positive, but there's one particular sequence that was so special in its awfulness, it had to go on this list. See if you can guess which one it is.
Chicago just got a major caffeine jolt from Starbucks.
The Ferrari-beater you've probably never heard of
James Holzhauer and Emma Boettcher finally reunited in the Jeopardy! Tournament of Champions 2-night final. Boettcher knocked Holzhauer out of regular Jeopardy! play back in June, when he was only $58,484 short of Ken Jennings massive $2.62 million in winnings. Ever since that day fans have been hoping for a rematch. Leading up to the rematch, Holzhauer had playfully tweeted about getting his revenge. He got off to a hot start, answering 23 clues correctly. Boettcher was only able to get 13 correct answers, so going into ""Final Jeopardy!"" Holzhauer ($37,412) had nearly three times as much money as Boettcher ($13,200). Boettcher went all in with her wager for the category ""Old Testament Book."" The clue was, ""By Hebrew word count, the longest book bears this name that led to a word for a long complaint or rant."" Emma correctly answered, ""What is Jeremiah?"" Holzhauer also got the correct answer and bid $11,914, bringing his grand total for the first night to $49,326. Fans took to Twitter to discuss his dominant performance. It should be noted that there is a third contestant in the finals, Francois Barcomb. Unfortunately he ended the night with only $1,800 and it is highly unlikely he will pose much of a threat to the other juggernauts.
Prepare your children early in life to be financially independent. If not, your retirement plan may need to include funding your irresponsible adult child's lifestyle, in addition to funding your own retirement.
It was an unusual emergency when a 17-year-old girl got hopelessly tangled in her seatbelt.
President Donald Trump will try to convince U.S. allies that they should increase defense spending when he attends a meeting of NATO leaders next month in London, the White House said Friday.
For many watching Saturday night, it will be difficult to get past the name Baylor when the undefeated Bears play Oklahoma. Perhaps that's fair.

Boettcher knocked Holzhauer out of regular Jeopardy! play back in June, when he was only $58,484 short of Ken Jennings massive $2.62 million in winnings. Ever since that day fans have been hoping for a rematch. Leading up to the rematch, Holzhauer had playfully tweeted about getting his revenge. He got off to a hot start, answering 23 clues correctly. Boettcher was only able to get 13 correct answers, so going into ""Final Jeopardy!"" Holzhauer ($37,412) had nearly three times as much money as Boettcher ($13,200). Boettcher went all in with her wager for the category ""Old Testament Book."" The clue was, ""By Hebrew word count, the longest book bears this name that led to a word for a long complaint or rant."" Emma correctly answered, ""What is Jeremiah?"" Holzhauer also got the correct answer and bid $11,914, bringing his grand total for the first night to $49,326. Fans took to Twitter to discuss his dominant performance. It should be noted that there is a third contestant in the finals, Francois Barcomb. Unfortunately he ended the night with only $1,800 and it is highly unlikely he will pose much of a threat to the other juggernauts.

A group traveling along a remote road in Gjirokast r, Albania, on November 11 had to do a double-take as they passed a flock of sheep blocking traffic. There, among the sheep, was an equally white and fluffy dog who looked more than happy to join the crowd. A German visitor to the region, Matthias Goedeking, took the video and told Storyful that he and his traveling companions originally came across ""a herd of sheep on the road and a shepherd who was visibly unhappy about that fact."" When they spotted the dog in the crowd, they followed alongside the pooch for a while, before it disappeared   Where's Waldo? style   into the white mass of sheep surrounding it.

A Kentucky woman has been charged in the death of a woman missing since spring whose remains may have been found last week.
And it's putting their retirement security at risk

Meet this week's inspiring kid.
James Holzhauer and Emma Boettcher finally reunited in the Jeopardy! Tournament of Champions 2-night final. Boettcher knocked Holzhauer out of regular Jeopardy! play back in June, when he was only $58,484 short of Ken Jennings massive $2.62 million in winnings. Ever since that day fans have been hoping for a rematch. Leading up to the rematch, Holzhauer had playfully tweeted about getting his revenge. He got off to a hot start, answering 23 clues correctly. Boettcher was only able to get 13 correct answers, so going into ""Final Jeopardy!"" Holzhauer ($37,412) had nearly three times as much money as Boettcher ($13,200). Boettcher went all in with her wager for the category ""Old Testament Book."" The clue was, ""By Hebrew word count, the longest book bears this name that led to a word for a long complaint or rant."" Emma correctly answered, ""What is Jeremiah?"" Holzhauer also got the correct answer and bid $11,914, bringing his grand total for the first night to $49,326. Fans took to Twitter to discuss his dominant performance. It should be noted that there is a third contestant in the finals, Francois Barcomb. Unfortunately he ended the night with only $1,800 and it is highly unlikely he will pose much of a threat to the other juggernauts.
