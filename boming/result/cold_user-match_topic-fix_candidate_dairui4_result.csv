James Holzhauer and Emma Boettcher finally reunited in the Jeopardy! Tournament of Champions 2-night final. Boettcher knocked Holzhauer out of regular Jeopardy! play back in June, when he was only $58,484 short of Ken Jennings massive $2.62 million in winnings. Ever since that day fans have been hoping for a rematch. Leading up to the rematch, Holzhauer had playfully tweeted about getting his revenge. He got off to a hot start, answering 23 clues correctly. Boettcher was only able to get 13 correct answers, so going into ""Final Jeopardy!"" Holzhauer ($37,412) had nearly three times as much money as Boettcher ($13,200). Boettcher went all in with her wager for the category ""Old Testament Book."" The clue was, ""By Hebrew word count, the longest book bears this name that led to a word for a long complaint or rant."" Emma correctly answered, ""What is Jeremiah?"" Holzhauer also got the correct answer and bid $11,914, bringing his grand total for the first night to $49,326. Fans took to Twitter to discuss his dominant performance. It should be noted that there is a third contestant in the finals, Francois Barcomb. Unfortunately he ended the night with only $1,800 and it is highly unlikely he will pose much of a threat to the other juggernauts.","  The top 10 recommended news headlines, ranked solely by relevance to the user's interests, are:
