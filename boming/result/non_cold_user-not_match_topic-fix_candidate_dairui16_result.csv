There aren't many things that are scarier than a lion. But a lion ""packed full of bees"" would definitely be on the list. Rihan Hoglin, of Hoglin Honey Bees, posted this video to Instagram after he and his team collected the statue from a property in Manning, a suburb of Perth, Western Australia, on October 21. The caption said, ""You don't come across this every day   a lion statue packed full of bees. Wouldn't this be an awesome antitheft deterrent sitting in front of your house?"" Hoglin told Storyful that he and his team had been called to remove the bees from the garden decoration by its 75-year-old owner, who happened to be ""highly allergic to bee stings."" The statue meant a great deal to its owner because it was a gift from her late grandson, Hoglin said. Hoglin Honey Bees removed the bees from the statue free of charge as a gesture of kindness.

There, among the sheep, was an equally white and fluffy dog who looked more than happy to join the crowd. A German visitor to the region, Matthias Goedeking, took the video and told Storyful that he and his traveling companions originally came across ""a herd of sheep on the road and a shepherd who was visibly unhappy about that fact."" When they spotted the dog in the crowd, they followed alongside the pooch for a while, before it disappeared   Where's Waldo? style   into the white mass of sheep surrounding it. Goedeking said a combination of very careful driving, the ""shepherd banging his crook"" on a railing, as well as ""lots of honking the car"" got him and his companions past the horde of furry creatures in the end.

A group traveling along a remote road in Gjirokast r, Albania, on November 11 had to do a double-take as they passed a flock of sheep blocking traffic. There, among the sheep, was an equally white and fluffy dog who looked more than happy to join the crowd. A German visitor to the region, Matthias Goedeking, took the video and told Storyful that he and his traveling companions originally came across ""a herd of sheep on the road and a shepherd who was visibly unhappy about that fact."" When they spotted the dog in the crowd, they followed alongside the pooch for a while, before it disappeared   Where's Waldo? style   into the white mass of sheep surrounding it. Goedeking said a combination of very careful driving, the ""shepherd banging his crook"" on a railing, as well as ""lots of honking the car"" got him and his companions past the horde of furry creatures in the end.
