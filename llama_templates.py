# Input:
User's History News:
{history}
Candidate News:
{candidate}

# Task Description:
1. 'User's History News' features headlines that have previously engaged the user, signaling their interests.
2. 'Candidate News' presents a set of headlines not yet seen by the user. The sequence of these headlines should not influence the ranking.
3. Your objective is to impartially select the top 10 headlines from 'Candidate News' that most closely resonate with the user's interests as reflected in 'User's History News'.

# Recommendation Process:
1. Independently assess 'User's History News' to deduce the user's core interested topics.
2. Scrutinize the topics of 'Candidate News', disregarding their initial order, to gauge their relevance to the userâ€™s interests.
3. Strategically rank the 'Candidate News' headlines by relevance, not by their original placement in the list.

# Output Format:
- Start with the phrase: "The top 10 recommended news headlines, ranked solely by relevance to the user's interests, are: C#, C#, C#, C#, C#, C#, C#, C#, C#, C#."
- Proceed with a relevance-based justification for each headline's ranking, such as: "C# pertains to topics X, Y, Z, which align with the user's interest shown in headlines H#, H#, H#."
- Maintain this structure for each of the top 10 headlines.
- The total output should not exceed a 200-word limit, focusing on the alignment of topics rather than the original order of 'Candidate News'."""
