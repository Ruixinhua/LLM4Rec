# Task Description
1. 'User's History News' features headlines that have previously engaged the user, signaling their interests.
2. 'Candidate News' presents a set of headlines not yet seen by the user. The sequence of these headlines should not influence the ranking.
3. Your objective is to impartially select the top 10 headlines from 'Candidate News' that most closely resonate with the user's interests as reflected in 'User's History News'.

# Recommendation Process
1. Independently assess 'User's History News' to deduce the user's core interested topics.
2. Scrutinize the topics of 'Candidate News', disregarding their initial order, to gauge their relevance to the userâ€™s interests.
3. Strategically rank the 'Candidate News' headlines by relevance, not by their original placement in the list.

# Output Format
- Start with the phrase: "The top 10 recommended news headlines, ranked solely by relevance to the user's interests, are: C#, C#, C#, C#, C#, C#, C#, C#, C#, C#."
- Proceed with a relevance-based justification for each headline's ranking, such as: "C# pertains to topics X, Y, Z, which align with the user's interest shown in headlines H#, H#, H#."
- Maintain this structure for each of the top 10 headlines.
- The total output should not exceed a 200-word limit, focusing on the alignment of topics rather than the original order of 'Candidate News'."""

# - Whether the keywords extracted from the recommender's answer accurately summarise the topics of interest to the user.
# - Whether the recommender's answer correctly extracts keywords from the candidate news and correctly matches the user's interests.
# Based on the observations, you can enhance the prompt by adding a description of the recommendation task, the breakdown of the recommendation process, and the constraints on the final output format so that the recommender can make corresponding recommendations based on semantics only. Here are some suggestions for enhancing the prompt:
# - Under "# Task Description", you can add a description of the news recommendation task, such as 'User's History News' being the news the user has interacted with previously and 'Candidate News' being news the user may be interested in. The recommendation should solely rely on the user's interests, not the order in which the news appears in 'Candidate News'. This task selects the news most relevant to the user's interests.
# - Under "# Recommendation Process", a detailed recommendation process can be added, such as first analyzing and summarizing the user's interests. Keywords are extracted from 'User's History News' and then grouped by meaning, with semantically similar words representing related concepts called a "Topic". These keywords can summarize and infer topics the user is interested in. Then, extract keywords from 'Candidate News' and analyze how well the keywords extracted from each Candidate News match the user's topics of interest. Again, it emphasized that the recommendation should not be affected by the position of the news in the  'Candidate News' but only by the matching relationship between the candidate news and the user's interests.
# - Under "# Output Format", define the output format. Summarize the user's interest and rank candidate news according to their relevance to the user's interest in the format:  "The top 10 recommended news headlines, ranked solely by relevance to the user's interests: <START>C#, C#, C#, C#, C#, C#, C#, C#, C#, C#<END>".
