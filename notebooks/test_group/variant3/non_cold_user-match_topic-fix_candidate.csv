Here's how the stars dressed up while celebrating Halloween this year!
Fall family fun! Kim Kardashian, Kanye West and their kids went all out with elaborate Flintstone family costumes for Halloween. ""Yabba Dabba Doo!"" the Keeping Up With the Kardashians star, 39, captioned a series of photos of herself with her children North, 6, Saint, 4, Chicago, 21 months, and Psalm, 5 months. ""This family pic was such a challenge because Chicago was so scared of Dino! LOL We tried to explain and show her that it was just daddy but she didn't get the concept yet! So shout out to the photographer for editing her in & making our family Flinstones dreams come true!"" While the reality star channeled Betty Rubble in a black wig and blue dress, her son looked just like Fred Flintstone. His older sister wore a red wig and all-white as Wilma Flintstone, and his younger one was all smiles as Bamm-Bamm Rubble. Kardashian held Psalm in a tiny version of the outfit. North also dressed up for Halloween with her cousin Penelope and their friend. Kourtney Kardashian's daughter, 7, rocked a long white wig and an angel-devil costume, while North was a straight devil in red fur. As for Kim, the makeup mogul debuted an extravagant Elle Woods costume, channeling Reese Witherspoon in Legally Blonde. The Selfish author even recreated the character's iconic Harvard video essay from the 2001 movie, wearing pink and green sequined bathing suits and a pink dress, all with a blonde wig. The KKW Beauty creator has passed on her love of fashion and beauty to her daughter North. The little one loves makeup, but her dad, 42, doesn't approve. ""Her dad won't let her wear it,"" Kim told E! News in September. ""I think he had it, he changed all the rules. I'd let her wear, you know, she has a little red for Christmas, I'd let her wear a red lip, or I'd let her do one pop of something. I'd let her if she's wearing a black dress, a black lip. Kylie [Jenner] would give her all of these lip kits, so I kind of got in trouble for that. So, it's now no more makeup."" The Los Angeles native opened up about their disagreement further the following month, telling the outlet: ""North is trying to get in on the makeup, but she's being blocked heavily because her dad has stopped all makeup for her until she is a teenager. It's a big discussion, a big fight in the household right now but it is what's best. I think as a parent you just learn and figure it out as you go and we realized we didn't really want her to wear makeup at a young age but she sees her mom putting on lipstick and lip gloss.""

Ladies and gentlemen, it pains us to bring you this most tragic of slideshows. Actually, it really doesn't. In fact, we're rather excited to showcase what the future might hold for BMW should this current fascination with fantastically large grilles be allowed to continue unchecked. Perhaps this in-your-face display of kidneys gone wild will at least encourage designers in Munich to think twice before traveling further down this road. Us Motor1.com scribes work very hard to keep a neutral tone, but frankly, we're a bit worried about BMW. This big-grille fad is as ridiculous as the pet rock only without the cool hipster factor. It's as off-putting as listening to glam rock on a scratched-up record. We blame Lexus for this, and while some brands have pulled off the gaping grille with admirable results   we're looking at you, Audi RS6 Avant   oversized kidneys basically turn every BMW into a beaver joke waiting to happen. That's not a good thing. Bigger Isn't Better: BMW Concept 4 Debuts With Massive Double Kidney Grille Reviled BMW Concept 4 Grille Redesigned By Another Fan We aren't alone on this. Peruse the comments of any Motor1.com articles referencing this bonkers nose and you'll find plenty of criticism. Rendering artists the world over have attempted to make the big grille look better, while others   including the anonymous designer who graciously sent us the designs featured above   are ready to show us a world where every BMW is, in a word, ugly. And yes, with BMW's deep involvement in the Toyota Supra, we couldn't resist leading with a makeover that could well come to the Supra's convertible twin, the Z4. Sure, the facelift could've been on an actual Z4, but seeing the double kidney on a Supra has a bit more shock factor. Jump into the slideshow at the top of this article to see just how deep   and how big   this kidney-shaped rabbit hole can grow.

Queen Elizabeth's Cousin: Royal Family 'Don't Communicate Very Well'
The comedy legend also spills details on the 'Coming to America' sequel!
Is there anything he can't do?
Dangerous fire conditions Monday fueled blazes in Pacific Palisades and San Bernardino, where at least three homes burned and evacuations were underway nearly into the night, as firefighters throughout the state braced for extreme fire conditions in coming days.
A Santa Clarita, California, resident mourned the loss of her home and ranch on October 24 after it was engulfed by the fast-moving Tick Fire, which ignited close to Tick Canyon Road near Agua Dulce. Alejandra Corrales shared video of burning wreckage and said, ""So this is what is left of the house   nothing."" ""It's just sitting here, burning down,"" Corrales said in an emotional narration as she panned over the property, where sporadic flames still burned. ""Nobody's here. They just left."" Corrales said some of her animals had died in the fire and the surviving ones were too frightened to go with her to safety. ""We have three sheep left. Everybody else is dead,"" she says in the video. Liliana Burkamp, a resident of Murrieta, California, also posted a video on Facebook on October 25 depicting what she said was the aftermath of the Tick Fire on Corrales's home in Santa Clarita, as well as a GoFundMe page for the Corrales family. The fire started at 1.24 pm on October 24 but only five percent of it has been contained. Approximately 40,000 residents in the area were under an evacuation order on October 25. Nearly 600 firefighters have been deployed to the area. The LA County Fire Department said erratic winds were posing a challenge to firefighters, as ""they may change direction and intensify, posing a greater threat to homes."" The Los Angeles Daily News reported that the fire had jumped the 14 Freeway early on the morning of October 25 and threatened even more homes. Credit: Alejandra Corrales via Storyful
