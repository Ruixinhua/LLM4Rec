A group traveling along a remote road in Gjirokast r, Albania, on November 11 had to do a double-take as they passed a flock of sheep blocking traffic. There, among the sheep, was an equally white and fluffy dog who looked more than happy to join the crowd. A German visitor to the region, Matthias Goedeking, took the video and told Storyful that he and his traveling companions originally came across ""a herd of sheep on the road and a shepherd who was visibly unhappy about that fact."" When they spotted the dog in the crowd, they followed alongside the pooch for a while, before it disappeared   Where's Waldo? style   into the white mass of sheep surrounding it. Goedeking said a combination of very careful driving, the ""shepherd banging his crook"" on a railing, as well as ""lots of honking the car"" got him and his companions past the horde of furry creatures in the end.

James Holzhauer and Emma Boettcher finally reunited in the Jeopardy! Tournament of Champions 2-night final. Boettcher knocked Holzhauer out of regular Jeopardy! play back in June, when he was only $58,484 short of Ken Jennings massive $2.62 million in winnings. Ever since that day fans have been hoping for a rematch. Leading up to the rematch, Holzhauer had playfully tweeted about getting his revenge. He got off to a hot start, answering 23 clues correctly. Boettcher was only able to get 13 correct answers, so going into ""Final Jeopardy!"" Holzhauer ($37,412) had nearly three times as much money as Boettcher ($13,200). Boettcher went all in with her wager for the category ""Old Testament Book."" The clue was, ""By Hebrew word count, the longest book bears this name that led to a word for a long complaint or rant."" Emma correctly answered, ""What is Jeremiah?"" Holzhauer also got the correct answer and bid $11,914, bringing his grand total for the first night to $49,326. Fans took to Twitter to discuss his dominant performance. It should be noted that there is a third contestant in the finals, Francois Barcomb. Unfortunately he ended the night with only $1,800 and it is highly unlikely he will pose much of a threat to the other juggernauts."

Arnold Schwarzenegger dropped by Jimmy Kimmel Live!, Monday, and the legendary action star could not stop gushing over his new son-in-law Chris Pratt. Chris married Katherine Schwarzenegger in June, but only after he proved to Arnold that he was strong enough to be her man. When Katherine first told Arnold that she was dating Chris, the former governor of California said he was ""blown away."" ""I was saying do you have to be so competitive?"" recalled Arnold. ""Do you have to have a guy that is taller than me, that is bigger than me, that's doing bigger movies than me and all of this kind of stuff, that makes more money than me?"" Arnold says he immediately got along with Chris. ""He is such a great guy, said Arnold. ""Not only very talented guy and a great actor and a great star and all this stuff but a really kind man and kind to my daughter, which is the most important thing for me."" While all of the aforementioned traits are things most parents look for in their children's spouse, Arnold admitted Chris's muscles helped. Arnold joked, ""Pumping iron was the decision-making factor."" Arnold worked out with Chris and was quite impressed. ""He's a strong guy, there's no two ways about it, and I'm very proud of him,"" said Arnold. ""When I watched him make these moves in the gym, you know, the incline press specifically did it. Why I wanted him to become my son-in-law. It was the incline press.""

Bill Gates, the Microsoft co-founder, waded deep in to the hotly debated topic of taxing the wealthy to redistribute money to the have-nots   a contentious issue that Sen. Elizabeth Warren has been at the forefront of as she bids to become the 2020 Democratic presidential nominee.
After some dumb thing called the World Series tragically preempted The Masked Singer for two friggin' weeks in a friggin' row   prompting Twitter outrage and ruining everyone's Halloween-week fun (for Masked Singer fans, apparently there is crying in baseball)   this Wednesday, Fox finally got back to focusing on America's real favorite pastime: watching C- and D-list mystery celebrities dress up in Halloween-inspo costumes and belt out Lizzo and OneRepublic hits. And it was a double-header, to use some baseball terminology, because Fox made up for lost time by airing two episodes back-to-back. Of course, double the fun meant double the eliminations, so this week we had to bid farewell to two furry friends: the Penguin, aka comedian Sherri Shepherd, and the Black Widow, aka former child star Raven-Symone. Jenny McCarthy had guessed that pretty much every female contestant since Season1 was Shepherd, so she was destined to be correct eventually. As for the Black Widow, I got that one right. I knew that eight-legged diva was so Raven from the very beginning. Anyway, while I have missed The Masked Singer like a Rottweiler misses his bone, a flower misses the sun, or a black widow misses her web, on the plus side, the past two weeks have given me some time off to reflect, furiously pore over various Google search queries and Wikipedia pages, and change my uneducated guesses since the last time many of these kooky cosplay characters rocked the mic. I now return to the show refreshed, renewed, and ready to keep my semi-winning streak going.","N40982

A German visitor to the region, Matthias Goedeking, took the video and told Storyful that he and his traveling companions originally came across ""a herd of sheep on the road and a shepherd who was visibly unhappy about that fact.""

Billy Shelby, a Missouri sanitation worker in the Kansas City area, has been wheeling an elderly woman's trash can back up her long driveway for several months after witnessing her fall attempting the task in January. But after footage of Shelby's now-regular gesture of kindness toward 88-year-old Opal Zucca was posted online on October 15, the driver for Waste Management has become an online hero. Zucca's daughter Colette Kingston shared the video of Shelby guiding her mother back up the driveway of Zucca's Independence, Missouri, home on Facebook. After returning Zucca's trash can to its spot beside the house, Shelby gives her a hug and jovially compliments her hair. ""God bless you, as always, darling,"" Shelby says in the video. In the post, Kingston detailed the story behind it. ""In January, my mom fell while trying to bring the trash can back up her driveway and got hurt. This gentleman from Waste Management was there when it happened,"" she wrote. ""Ever since, he has brought the can back up the driveway for mom. This was him today helping her; he demonstrates such care for her. It takes a village,"" she said, adding that the ""small kind gesture"" serves as an ""enormous relief for us."" Kingston rounded off the note with, ""Thank you kind sir. Love, the Zucca family."" Shelby soon had local media requesting interviews, and he told Fox 4 News that he ""made a point of making sure"" that Zucca's incident in January would not be repeated.

A German visitor to the region, Matthias Goedeking, took the video and told Storyful that he and his traveling companions originally came across ""a herd of sheep on the road and a shepherd who was visibly unhappy about that fact.""

Goedeking said a combination of very careful driving, the ""shepherd banging his crook"" on a railing, as well as ""lots of honking the car"" got him and his companions past the horde of furry creatures in the end.

Boettcher was only able to get 13 correct answers, so going into ""Final Jeopardy!"" Holzhauer ($37,412) had nearly three times as much money as Boettcher ($13,200). Boettcher went all in with her wager for the category ""Old Testament Book."" The clue was, ""By Hebrew word count, the longest book bears this name that led to a word for a long complaint or rant."" Emma correctly answered, ""What is Jeremiah?"" Holzhauer also got the correct answer and bid $11,914, bringing his grand total for the first night to $49,326. Fans took to Twitter to discuss his dominant performance. It should be noted that there is a third contestant in the finals, Francois Barcomb. Unfortunately he ended the night with only $1,800 and it is highly unlikely he will pose much of a threat to the other juggernauts.

After some dumb thing called the World Series tragically preempted The Masked Singer for two friggin' weeks in a friggin' row   prompting Twitter outrage and ruining everyone's Halloween-week fun (for Masked Singer fans, apparently there is crying in baseball)   this Wednesday, Fox finally got back to focusing on America's real favorite pastime: watching C- and D-list mystery celebrities dress up in Halloween-inspo costumes and belt out Lizzo and OneRepublic hits. And it was a double-header, to use some baseball terminology, because Fox made up for lost time by airing two episodes back-to-back. Of course, double the fun meant double the eliminations, so this week we had to bid farewell to two furry friends: the Penguin, aka comedian Sherri Shepherd, and the Black Widow, aka former child star Raven-Symone. Jenny McCarthy had guessed that pretty much every female contestant since Season1 was Shepherd, so she was destined to be correct eventually. As for the Black Widow, I got that one right. I knew that eight-legged diva was so Raven from the very beginning. Anyway, while I have missed The Masked Singer like a Rottweiler misses his bone, a flower misses the sun, or a black widow misses her web, on the plus side, the past two weeks have given me some time off to reflect, furiously pore over various Google search queries and Wikipedia pages, and change my uneducated guesses since the last time many of these kooky cosplay characters rocked the mic. I now return to the show refreshed, renewed, and ready to keep my semi-winning streak going.","N55237

So shout out to the photographer for editing her in & making our family Flinstones dreams come true!"" While the reality star channeled Betty Rubble in a black wig and blue dress, her son looked just like Fred Flintstone. His older sister wore a red wig and all-white as Wilma Flintstone, and his younger one was all smiles as Bamm-Bamm Rubble. Kardashian held Psalm in a tiny version of the outfit. North also dressed up for Halloween with her cousin Penelope and their friend. Kourtney Kardashian's daughter, 7, rocked a long white wig and an angel-devil costume, while North was a straight devil in red fur. As for Kim, the makeup mogul debuted an extravagant Elle Woods costume, channeling Reese Witherspoon in Legally Blonde. The Selfish author even recreated the character's iconic Harvard video essay from the 2001 movie, wearing pink and green sequined bathing suits and a pink dress, all with a blonde wig. The KKW Beauty creator has passed on her love of fashion and beauty to her daughter North. The little one loves makeup, but her dad, 42, doesn't approve. ""Her dad won't let her wear it,"" Kim told E! News in September. ""I think he had it, he changed all the rules. I'd let her wear, you know, she has a little red for Christmas, I'd let her wear a red lip, or I'd let her do one pop of something. I'd let her if she's wearing a black dress, a black lip. Kylie [Jenner] would give her all of these lip kits, so I kind of got in trouble for that. So, it's now no more makeup."" The Los Angeles native opened up about their disagreement further the following month, telling the outlet: ""North is trying to get in on the makeup, but she's being blocked heavily because her dad has stopped all makeup for her until she is a teenager. It's a big discussion, a big fight in the household right now but it is what's best. I think as a parent you just learn and figure it out as you go and we realized we didn't really want her to wear makeup at a young age but she sees her mom putting on lipstick and lip gloss.""

There aren't many things that are scarier than a lion. But a lion ""packed full of bees"" would definitely be on the list. Rihan Hoglin, of Hoglin Honey Bees, posted this video to Instagram after he and his team collected the statue from a property in Manning, a suburb of Perth, Western Australia, on October 21. The caption said, ""You don't come across this every day   a lion statue packed full of bees. Wouldn't this be an awesome antitheft deterrent sitting in front of your house?"" Hoglin told Storyful that he and his team had been called to remove the bees from the garden decoration by its 75-year-old owner, who happened to be ""highly allergic to bee stings."" The statue meant a great deal to its owner because it was a gift from her late grandson, Hoglin said. Hoglin Honey Bees removed the bees from the statue free of charge as a gesture of kindness.

It was a vivid scene worthy of the ending of a Hollywood thriller, the image of a ruthless terrorist mastermind finally brought to justice ""whimpering and crying and screaming all the way"" to his death. But it may be no more true than a movie script.
British music and film producer Nik Powell, who was among the Virgin Group co-founders with Richard Branson and became an influential force in U.K. cinema, producing more than 60 titles including Neil Jordan's Oscar-winning ""The Crying Game,"" died Thursday at age 69.

There, among the sheep, was an equally white and fluffy dog who looked more than happy to join the crowd. A German visitor to the region, Matthias Goedeking, took the video and told Storyful that he and his traveling companions originally came across ""a herd of sheep on the road and a shepherd who was visibly unhappy about that fact."" When they spotted the dog in the crowd, they followed alongside the pooch for a while, before it disappeared   Where's Waldo? style   into the white mass of sheep surrounding it. Goedeking said a combination of very careful driving, the ""shepherd banging his crook"" on a railing, as well as ""lots of honking the car"" got him and his companions past the horde of furry creatures in the end.

After making $12.5 million from 3,790 screens on Friday, ""Mistress of Evil"" is now projected for a $38 million opening weekend. That's below pre-weekend projections of a $45 million opening and well below the $69 million opening earned by the first ""Maleficent."" Also...

Here's how the stars dressed up while celebrating Halloween this year!
Fall family fun! Kim Kardashian, Kanye West and their kids went all out with elaborate Flintstone family costumes for Halloween. ""Yabba Dabba Doo!"" the Keeping Up With the Kardashians star, 39, captioned a series of photos of herself with her children North, 6, Saint, 4, Chicago, 21 months, and Psalm, 5 months. ""This family pic was such a challenge because Chicago was so scared of Dino! LOL We tried to explain and show her that it was just daddy but she didn't get the concept yet! So shout out to the photographer for editing her in & making our family Flinstones dreams come true!"" While the reality star channeled Betty Rubble in a black wig and blue dress, her son looked just like Fred Flintstone. His older sister wore a red wig and all-white as Wilma Flintstone, and his younger one was all smiles as Bamm-Bamm Rubble. Kardashian held Psalm in a tiny version of the outfit. North also dressed up for Halloween with her cousin Penelope and their friend. Kourtney Kardashian's daughter, 7, rocked a long white wig and an angel-devil costume, while North was a straight devil in red fur. As for Kim, the makeup mogul debuted an extravagant Elle Woods costume, channeling Reese Witherspoon in Legally Blonde. The Selfish author even recreated the character's iconic Harvard video essay from the 2001 movie, wearing pink and green sequined bathing suits and a pink dress, all with a blonde wig. The KKW Beauty creator has passed on her love of fashion and beauty to her daughter North. The little one loves makeup, but her dad, 42, doesn't approve. ""Her dad won't let her wear it,"" Kim told E! News in September. ""I think he had it, he changed all the rules. I'd let her wear, you know, she has a little red for Christmas, I'd let her wear a red lip, or I'd let her do one pop of something. I'd let her if she's wearing a black dress, a black lip. Kylie [Jenner] would give her all of these lip kits, so I kind of got in trouble for that. So, it's now no more makeup."" The Los Angeles native opened up about their disagreement further the following month, telling the outlet: ""North is trying to get in on the makeup, but she's being blocked heavily because her dad has stopped all makeup for her until she is a teenager. It's a big discussion, a big fight in the household right now but it is what's best. I think as a parent you just learn and figure it out as you go and we realized we didn't really want her to wear makeup at a young age but she sees her mom putting on lipstick and lip gloss.""

Fall family fun! Kim Kardashian, Kanye West and their kids went all out with elaborate Flintstone family costumes for Halloween. ""Yabba Dabba Doo!"" the Keeping Up With the Kardashians star, 39, captioned a series of photos of herself with her children North, 6, Saint, 4, Chicago, 21 months, and Psalm, 5 months. ""This family pic was such a challenge because Chicago was so scared of Dino! LOL We tried to explain and show her that it was just daddy but she didn't get the concept yet! So shout out to the photographer for editing her in & making our family Flinstones dreams come true!"" While the reality star channeled Betty Rubble in a black wig and blue dress, her son looked just like Fred Flintstone. His older sister wore a red wig and all-white as Wilma Flintstone, and his younger one was all smiles as Bamm-Bamm Rubble. Kardashian held Psalm in a tiny version of the outfit. North also dressed up for Halloween with her cousin Penelope and their friend. Kourtney Kardashian's daughter, 7, rocked a long white wig and an angel-devil costume, while North was a straight devil in red fur. As for Kim, the makeup mogul debuted an extravagant Elle Woods costume, channeling Reese Witherspoon in Legally Blonde. The Selfish author even recreated the character's iconic Harvard video essay from the 2001 movie, wearing pink and green sequined bathing suits and a pink dress, all with a blonde wig. The KKW Beauty creator has passed on her love of fashion and beauty to her daughter North. The little one loves makeup, but her dad, 42, doesn't approve. ""Her dad won't let her wear it,"" Kim told E! News in September. ""I think he had it, he changed all the rules. I'd let her wear, you know, she has a little red for Christmas, I'd let her wear a red lip, or I'd let her do one pop of something. I'd let her if she's wearing a black dress, a black lip. Kylie [Jenner] would give her all of these lip kits, so I kind of got in trouble for that. So, it's now no more makeup."" The Los Angeles native opened up about their disagreement further the following month, telling the outlet: ""North is trying to get in on the makeup, but she's being blocked heavily because her dad has stopped all makeup for her until she is a teenager. It's a big discussion, a big fight in the household right now but it is what's best. I think as a parent you just learn and figure it out as you go and we realized we didn't really want her to wear makeup at a young age but she sees her mom putting on lipstick and lip gloss.""
Stephone Ritchie Sr. was on a family vacation in Florida when he died. ""He got caught in the waves,"" after ushering sons out of water, a cousin said.
The touching moment was captured on a resident's doorbell cam.

James Holzhauer and Emma Boettcher finally reunited in the Jeopardy! Tournament of Champions 2-night final. Boettcher knocked Holzhauer out of regular Jeopardy! play back in June, when he was only $58,484 short of Ken Jennings massive $2.62 million in winnings. Ever since that day fans have been hoping for a rematch. Leading up to the rematch, Holzhauer had playfully tweeted about getting his revenge. He got off to a hot start, answering 23 clues correctly. Boettcher was only able to get 13 correct answers, so going into ""Final Jeopardy!"" Holzhauer ($37,412) had nearly three times as much money as Boettcher ($13,200). Boettcher went all in with her wager for the category ""Old Testament Book."" The clue was, ""By Hebrew word count, the longest book bears this name that led to a word for a long complaint or rant."" Emma correctly answered, ""What is Jeremiah?"" Holzhauer also got the correct answer and bid $11,914, bringing his grand total for the first night to $49,326. Fans took to Twitter to discuss his dominant performance. It should be noted that there is a third contestant in the finals, Francois Barcomb. Unfortunately he ended the night with only $1,800 and it is highly unlikely he will pose much of a threat to the other juggernauts.

Meghan Markle stepped out for an important guest panel appearance in a maroon long-sleeved top with an eye-catching red leather pencil skirt.
A ridiculous amount of rain hit Japan on Friday, pushing back the second round of the PGA Tour's Zozo Championship.
The festivities took place before the House scheduled a vote on procedures for the impeachment inquiry into Trump on the day of Halloween, Oct. 31.
Fall family fun! Kim Kardashian, Kanye West and their kids went all out with elaborate Flintstone family costumes for Halloween. ""Yabba Dabba Doo!"" the Keeping Up With the Kardashians star, 39, captioned a series of photos of herself with her children North, 6, Saint, 4, Chicago, 21 months, and Psalm, 5 months. ""This family pic was such a challenge because Chicago was so scared of Dino! LOL We tried to explain and show her that it was just daddy but she didn't get the concept yet! So shout out to the photographer for editing her in & making our family Flinstones dreams come true!"" While the reality star channeled Betty Rubble in a black wig and blue dress, her son looked just like Fred Flintstone. His older sister wore a red wig and all-white as Wilma Flintstone, and his younger one was all smiles as Bamm-Bamm Rubble. Kardashian held Psalm in a tiny version of the outfit. North also dressed up for Halloween with her cousin Penelope and their friend. Kourtney Kardashian's daughter, 7, rocked a long white wig and an angel-devil costume, while North was a straight devil in red fur. As for Kim, the makeup mogul debuted an extravagant Elle Woods costume, channeling Reese Witherspoon in Legally Blonde. The Selfish author even recreated the character's iconic Harvard video essay from the 2001 movie, wearing pink and green sequined bathing suits and a pink dress, all with a blonde wig. The KKW Beauty creator has passed on her love of fashion and beauty to her daughter North. The little one loves makeup, but her dad, 42, doesn't approve. ""Her dad won't let her wear it,"" Kim told E! News in September. ""I think he had it, he changed all the rules. I'd let her wear, you know, she has a little red for Christmas, I'd let her wear a red lip, or I'd let her do one pop of something. I'd let her if she's wearing a black dress, a black lip. Kylie [Jenner] would give her all of these lip kits, so I kind of got in trouble for that. So, it's now no more makeup."" The Los Angeles native opened up about their disagreement further the following month, telling the outlet: ""North is trying to get in on the makeup, but she's being blocked heavily because her dad has stopped all makeup for her until she is a teenager. It's a big discussion, a big fight in the household right now but it is what's best. I think as a parent you just learn and figure it out as you go and we realized we didn't really want her to wear makeup at a young age but she sees her mom putting on lipstick and lip gloss.""
