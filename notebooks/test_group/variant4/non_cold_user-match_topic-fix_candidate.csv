Billy Shelby, a Missouri sanitation worker in the Kansas City area, has been wheeling an elderly woman's trash can back up her long driveway for several months after witnessing her fall attempting the task in January. But after footage of Shelby's now-regular gesture of kindness toward 88-year-old Opal Zucca was posted online on October 15, the driver for Waste Management has become an online hero. Zucca's daughter Colette Kingston shared the video of Shelby guiding her mother back up the driveway of Zucca's Independence, Missouri, home on Facebook. After returning Zucca's trash can to its spot beside the house, Shelby gives her a hug and jovially compliments her hair. ""God bless you, as always, darling,"" Shelby says in the video. In the post, Kingston detailed the story behind it. ""In January, my mom fell while trying to bring the trash can back up her driveway and got hurt. This gentleman from Waste Management was there when it happened,"" she wrote. ""Ever since, he has brought the can back up the driveway for mom. This was him today helping her; he demonstrates such care for her. It takes a village,"" she said, adding that the ""small kind gesture"" serves as an ""enormous relief for us."" Kingston rounded off the note with, ""Thank you kind sir. Love, the Zucca family."" Shelby soon had local media requesting interviews, and he told Fox 4 News that he ""made a point of making sure"" that Zucca's incident in January would not be repeated.

Arnold Schwarzenegger dropped by Jimmy Kimmel Live!, Monday, and the legendary action star could not stop gushing over his new son-in-law Chris Pratt. Chris married Katherine Schwarzenegger in June, but only after he proved to Arnold that he was strong enough to be her man. When Katherine first told Arnold that she was dating Chris, the former governor of California said he was ""blown away."" ""I was saying do you have to be so competitive?"" recalled Arnold. ""Do you have to have a guy that is taller than me, that is bigger than me, that's doing bigger movies than me and all of this kind of stuff, that makes more money than me?"" Arnold says he immediately got along with Chris. ""He is such a great guy, said Arnold. ""Not only very talented guy and a great actor and a great star and all this stuff but a really kind man and kind to my daughter, which is the most important thing for me."" While all of the aforementioned traits are things most parents look for in their children's spouse, Arnold admitted Chris's muscles helped. Arnold joked, ""Pumping iron was the decision-making factor."" Arnold worked out with Chris and was quite impressed. ""He's a strong guy, there's no two ways about it, and I'm very proud of him,"" said Arnold. ""When I watched him make these moves in the gym, you know, the incline press specifically did it. Why I wanted him to become my son-in-law. It was the incline press.""

A German visitor to the region, Matthias Goedeking, took the video and told Storyful that he and his traveling companions originally came across ""a herd of sheep on the road and a shepherd who was visibly unhappy about that fact.""

Goedeking said a combination of very careful driving, the ""shepherd banging his crook"" on a railing, as well as ""lots of honking the car"" got him and his companions past the horde of furry creatures in the end.

Bill Gates, the Microsoft co-founder, waded deep in to the hotly debated topic of taxing the wealthy to redistribute money to the have-nots   a contentious issue that Sen. Elizabeth Warren has been at the forefront of as she bids to become the 2020 Democratic presidential nominee.
After some dumb thing called the World Series tragically preempted The Masked Singer for two friggin' weeks in a friggin' row   prompting Twitter outrage and ruining everyone's Halloween-week fun (for Masked Singer fans, apparently there is crying in baseball)   this Wednesday, Fox finally got back to focusing on America's real favorite pastime: watching C- and D-list mystery celebrities dress up in Halloween-inspo costumes and belt out Lizzo and OneRepublic hits. And it was a double-header, to use some baseball terminology, because Fox made up for lost time by airing two episodes back-to-back. Of course, double the fun meant double the eliminations, so this week we had to bid farewell to two furry friends: the Penguin, aka comedian Sherri Shepherd, and the Black Widow, aka former child star Raven-Symone. Jenny McCarthy had guessed that pretty much every female contestant since Season1 was Shepherd, so she was destined to be correct eventually. As for the Black Widow, I got that one right. I knew that eight-legged diva was so Raven from the very beginning. Anyway, while I have missed The Masked Singer like a Rottweiler misses his bone, a flower misses the sun, or a black widow misses her web, on the plus side, the past two weeks have given me some time off to reflect, furiously pore over various Google search queries and Wikipedia pages, and change my uneducated guesses since the last time many of these kooky cosplay characters rocked the mic. I now return to the show refreshed, renewed, and ready to keep my semi-winning streak going.","N40982
