This is the terrifying moment a wild elephant crushed a passing car after refusing to let it drive by on a mountain road. The jumbo noticed the grey Toyota approaching on a bend in Nakhon Rathashima, northeastern Thailand, last Tuesday (October 29) afternoon. The large bull stomped over to the vehicle and kneeled on the bonnet before walking behind and laying its huge body across the rear windscreen. Shocked driver Phassakorn Niltarach was left cowering behind the steering wheel while the beast smashed the glass and dented the bodywork and damaged the mirrors. The vehicle eventually managed to move forward after the ordeal, lasting more than a minute. The woman who recorded the video is heard saying ""are you crazy?"" She then adds: ''You should have driven away earlier before the elephant had chance to do that."" Speaking after, the woman, who wanted to remain anonymous, said: ''I was so shocked when the elephant walked to the car and I was even more surprised when the elephant tried to sit on that car. ""It's lucky that the driver managed to get away safely. I want this to be an example because people should stay well away from the elephants. They might appear friendly but they could hurt you."" Wildlife rangers in the Khao Yai National Park said that the elephant was a 35-year-old male named Deu. They warned drivers to take extra care when driving through the mountain roads, where elephants often roam. Park ranger Kanchit Sarinpawan said that elephants often venture out of the forest around October when the country's monsoon rainy season ends and the dry and cool period begins. The official reassured motorists that the elephant's behaviour was ''just his way of greeting tourists.""

After some dumb thing called the World Series tragically preempted The Masked Singer for two friggin' weeks in a friggin' row   prompting Twitter outrage and ruining everyone's Halloween-week fun (for Masked Singer fans, apparently there is crying in baseball)   this Wednesday, Fox finally got back to focusing on America's real favorite pastime: watching C- and D-list mystery celebrities dress up in Halloween-inspo costumes and belt out Lizzo and OneRepublic hits. And it was a double-header, to use some baseball terminology, because Fox made up for lost time by airing two episodes back-to-back. Of course, double the fun meant double the eliminations, so this week we had to bid farewell to two furry friends: the Penguin, aka comedian Sherri Shepherd, and the Black Widow, aka former child star Raven-Symone. Jenny McCarthy had guessed that pretty much every female contestant since Season1 was Shepherd, so she was destined to be correct eventually. As for the Black Widow, I got that one right. I knew that eight-legged diva was so Raven from the very beginning. Anyway, while I have missed The Masked Singer like a Rottweiler misses his bone, a flower misses the sun, or a black widow misses her web, on the plus side, the past two weeks have given me some time off to reflect, furiously pore over various Google search queries and Wikipedia pages, and change my uneducated guesses since the last time many of these kooky cosplay characters rocked the mic. I now return to the show refreshed, renewed, and ready to keep my semi-winning streak going.

It was apparently a tough night for the Wheel of Fortune contestants Tuesday. All three contestants struggled to solve a puzzle, which seemed fairly simple. The final puzzle in regulation game play was a phrase, which quickly became ""TH_ Q_ _STION R_ _ _INS."" The first contestant guessed ""the question rounds"" and ""the question raising."" The second contestant added an ""M"" and then guessed ""the question reminds."" And finally the third contestant bought an ""E"" resulting in the puzzle ""THE Q_ ESTION RE_ _INS."" He didn't even try to guess before the buzzer sounded. Host Pat Sajak was shocked all three contestants could not solve the puzzle. And fans at home took to Twitter to voice their opinions on the matter. The puzzle came full circle and the first contestant got another crack at it. This time she guessed correctly, causing Sajak to exclaim, ""Good job. I never thought it would get back to you!""
