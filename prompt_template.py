template_best = """## Task Description
The goal is to recommend news articles to a user based on their history of news interactions. 'User's History News' represents articles the user has previously shown interest in, while 'Candidate News' comprises potential articles that may align with the user's interests. The recommendation should be made solely on the basis of the user's interests, without being influenced by the sequence of the 'Candidate News'. The task is to identify the news articles most relevant to the user's interests.

## Recommendation Process
1. Analyze 'User's History News' to identify and summarize the user's interests. Extract keywords and group them by meaning to form "Topics" that represent the user's areas of interest.
2. Extract keywords from 'Candidate News' and evaluate how well they align with the user's "Topics" of interest.
3. Ensure that the recommendation is not biased by the order of the 'Candidate News' but is solely based on the relevance of each candidate article to the user's interests.

## Input
### User's History News

# template_best = """## Task Description
# This task involves recommending news articles to the user based on their history news and interests. 'User's History News' represents the news the user has interacted with previously, and 'Candidate News' represents news the user may be interested in. The recommendation should solely rely on the user's interests, not on the order in which the news appears in 'Candidate News'. The goal is to select the news most relevant to the user's interests.

#
# ## Recommendation Process
# The recommendation process involves several steps:
# 1. Analyze and summarize the user's interests: Extract keywords from 'User's History News' and group them by meaning, with semantically similar words representing related concepts called a "Topic". These keywords can summarize and infer topics the user is interested in.
# 2. Extract keywords from 'Candidate News': Analyze how well the keywords extracted from each Candidate News match the user's topics of interest. Again, it is emphasized that the recommendation should not be affected by the position of the news in the 'Candidate News', but only by the matching relationship between the candidate news and the user's interests.
